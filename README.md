# externalSort
 
This is an attempt to code a program for external sorting in Java.
This code aims to use the concept of merge sort, merge k sorted arrays and minheap to complete the task. 

You might have to have two files "input.txt" and "output.txt" in the same directory for the program to populate the files with numbers then sort them.
